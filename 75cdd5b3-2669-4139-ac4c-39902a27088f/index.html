is something we look at as a starting point.  We have defined areas we want
to work on but we also realize that as we move through the five years, other
items may surface that need to be addressed before or after something we have
already planned.  Our goal is to always be looking at what we and those
who partner with us need to do to make Bellefonte a better place for its
businesses, residents, and visitors. </p><p>Listed below you will
find more detail information on what and how we plan to achieve the work laid
out in the five year plan. Each of the areas is of prime concern in the
Bellefonte community.  As with many other aging communities in
Pennsylvania we are struggling to maintain the businesses and residents we
currently have.</p><p>The Community
Development work plan, for the most part, is feasible.  The largest item
will require partnering with DCED local banks and all committees of the BMSRP.</p><p>CD 1.1 Establishing a
current business inventory is currently getting started; while, this part will
not require any money it will be a labor intensive project.  It has not
been done in the last eight years and there have been many changes. The
committee will also be gathering information from the businesses such as: hours
of operation, number of employees, and target customers. Once a current
inventory is established it will be updated at least annually. </p><p>CD 1.2 The business
recruitment plan will be a partnership with the Marketing/Promotion
committee.  The committee will be choosing areas to target and hopefully
establish businesses that would benefit the Bellefonte area. At this time there
is only 3 open store fronts. Need to work with property owners to make property
more attractive</p><p>CD 1.3 Review of the
market information with the business community will be done in small groups and
one on one. It is important they understand the local buying power and
preferences.</p><p>CD 1.4 The revolving
loan fund is and will be one of the most important undertakings of the entire
five year work plan.  The entire organization will have a part in deciding
the guidelines and how it will proceed.  The fund will be established to
help property owners with sprinkler systems.  Initially large anchor
buildings will get priority.  They have a large impact on neighboring
buildings.  As loans are repaid, there will always be money for
revitalization in Bellefonte. </p><p>CD 1.5 The Residential
recruitment plan would be mostly geared to young professionals. 
Bellefonte is an aging community and needs an influx of younger residents.</p><p>The Community
Marketing/Promotion committee will work mostly on marketing.  There are
currently several groups who have festivals and events in Bellefonte. </p><p>CM 1.1 The multi level
marketing plan will be comprehensive: including plans to attract new
businesses, new residents and tourists.  It will work at engaging current
residents and county employees to do business in Bellefonte</p><p>.</p><p>CM 1.2 Implementing the
multi-level marketing plan will be through social media, websites, brochures,
and expos.  A small amount will be spent on print, radio and television.</p><p>CM 1.3 As stated
previously in the narrative, there are already a good deal of events and
festivals that are held in Bellefonte.  They are not retail focused,
however, and the art/food walk would be held in stores and businesses where
people will interact with the artist/local food provider and also see what the
store has to offer. Hopefully, this will </p><p>CM 1.4 Sidewalks sales
were started this summer. The first was held during the Jazz Festival. 
The festival is held at Talleyrand Park and flyers were inserted in the Jazz
Festival programs about the sale.  It was a success.  Next year there
will be two sidewalk sales; one during the Jazz Festival and the other during
the Fall Foliage Train Rides. </p><p>CM 1.5 The “downtown”
website will feature news about events in businesses, restaurants and
organizations. Its main focus will be to promote downtown Bellefonte and what
it has to offer from apartments, retails stores, service businesses and
restaurants.</p><p>CM 1.6 The History Event
will be designed to celebrate the history of Bellefonte.  Initially it
will mainly be for the residents and Bellefonte School District students. Once
all the kinks are worked out it will become something to attract visitors to
Bellefonte</p><p> The Design
Committee has a challenging amount of work.  They will administrator the
façade grant program, and will be in charge of way finding signage.  These
are just some of the larger projects they will have.</p><p>DC 1.1 The Façade
Improvement program will be partnered with DCED, property owners and/or
businesses. Bellefonte’s designation area is also in the History District;
therefore, all projects will have to go before the historic review board for
approval.  We hope to work closely with everyone so the process is smooth</p><p>.</p><p> First one is under way </p><p>DC 1.2 A member of the
design committee does store front window design and has agreed to give classes
to merchants free of charge.  The first class will happen after a couple
of Golden Broom awards have been given.  The golden broom award should
help spark interest in the classes. This is a design and clean/green objective.</p><p>DC 1.3 The golden broom
award will focus on: cleanliness of the entrance, litter free, windows fresh
and clean plus a few more criteria.  There will be two awards presented
quarterly and there will be eight different categories.  The winning
categories will judge the following quarter awards. </p><p>DC 1.4 There was a
lighting study done two years ago. The committee will review it; see what has
been done and see how and if it is working and what else might still need to be
done.  The main reason for this is safety, both in the crosswalks and just
in general for people out at night.</p><p>DC 1.5 The parking study
will help determine all of the parking available, both private owned and
borough owned, in the business district. After the study the committee will
design and determine placement of way finding signs for the parking lots.
Merchants will be told about private lots that rent space.. Parking workshop
has been done</p><p>The organization
committee and the board/steering committee are one and the same.  There
may come a time when they split, however, for now it makes sense.  Much of
the work the organization committee will need to do would be done by many on
the steering/board. </p><p>OC 1.1 The Business and
Merchants group was established in February of 2014.  It is a subcommittee
of the organization/program.  It gives the merchants and businesses a
chance to air their concerns and work together on promotions.  It has been
working well.</p><p>OC 1.2 Bellefonte is the
county seat and hopefully by meeting with the employees and officials, we can
find ways to attract more business for our business establishments..</p><p>OC1.3 The newsletter
will be an e-newsletter and it will contain the events happening in Bellefonte,
and have items for the residents and members of the school district.</p><p>Need money for this happen to become part
chimp money or one of the list serves that send out the newsletter</p><p>OC1.4 The idea behind
the press release is to keep positive news about Bellefonte in the press as
often as possible.  This will entail building relationships with the
press. Have done a couple one ran in the express and Gazette (Golden Broom
award)</p><p>OC 1.5 The volunteer
recruitment is a very important element of the program and members will be
responsible for finding their own replacement when their term is up and also
finding a new volunteer yearly. </p><p>Five Year Work Plan Narrative for</p><p>Bellefonte Keystone Community Designation Application</p><p>Our five year work plan
